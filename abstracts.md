## Functional programming in Kotlin: exploring Arrow

Functional programming is gaining popularity and partly because of this people have been switching to Kotlin.
Although it fits the paradigm better than Java, there is still quite a bit missing to unleash the full power of FP.
Arrow is here to fill in the missing bits with things like new datatypes, e.g. Try, Either, and Optics. Arrow is the most popular functional programming library for Kotlin.
In this talk we will go through what problems Arrow can solve for you and how it can help you with your everyday programming.

## Java's new paradigm

The new Java features like records, sealed classes and pattern matching have all been added to support the Data Oriënted Programming paradigm.
But what is the idea behind it and what makes it diferrent from the Object Oriënted style or the Functional Programming style?
In this talk we will go into what Data Oriënted Programming is, what mindset you need for it and we will take a look at some Data Oriënted Programming patterns.
So if you want to be ready to code modern Java and would like to add another tool to your toolbox, this is the talk is the right talk for you.
