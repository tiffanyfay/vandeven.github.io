*Last updated on the 30th of July, 2019*

I've been developing software for a long time. My first programs were written in BASIC on a [Commodore VIC20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20) 
computer before my teenage years:

```basic
10 PRINT "Hello!"
20 GOTO 10
```

From BASIC I moved to Pascal, and from there to Delphi. Most of what I did in those days were text-based games and
Play by E-mail game processors, which gave me my first introduction to parsers.

My first steps in web development were in PHP, which I first started using about a year before I graduated high school.

At the University of Twente I was introduced to Java, which I immediately liked, but it wasn't until my internship at
Carthago ICT that I got my first taste of Java web development.

My first job after graduation, at Topicus Onderwijs, got me introduced to Apache Wicket, a framework I still love
and use extensively.

## What I like to code

I love building things that automate repetitive tasks. Code generators, annotation processors, custom maven plugins, you name it. I tend to
prefer automating the creation of dumb code over creating smart code that solves the same problem in fewer lines, for a
 very simple reason: it's far easier to debug dumb code.
 
More recently I've developed an interest in functional programming, which, if used in moderation, can simplify
quite a bit of logic.
 
Java (11 or higher) is still my language of choice, with Kotlin a close second. I'll happily take on
a Typescript-based project too, and also have a (relatively new) interest in Rust.

#### What I don't like to code

I have trouble taking anything built in PHP seriously, and will go out of my way to avoid the language
if at all possible.

And while I love Java, this love does not extend to frameworks such as JSF and certainly not to antiquated
technologies such as JSP.
 
## What I do besides coding
 
 [I write fantasy books](https://www.jeroensteenbeeke.nl), enjoy an occassional glass of Scotch, do endurance kickboxing, 
 bake bread, read a lot of books, play complicated and/or time-consuming video games (Crusader Kings 2, Dwarf Fortress,
 Factorio, Kerbal Space Program, Minecraft, Stardew Valley), go on a hike, and, most importantly,
 spend time with my family.
